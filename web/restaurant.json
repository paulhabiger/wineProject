[{"id":"1","location":"restaurant","name":"Dry Aged Ribeye","description":"This is as good as steak gets! ","pairing":"Try pairing this big boy steak with a big boy Cab. Stonestreet can hold it's own against this beast!\r\n"},{"id":"2","location":"restaurant","name":"Hand made Cavatelli","description":"Our cavatelli is hand made fresh daily. The sauce is a thick red ragu with our house made italian sausage. Topped with an herbed ricotta. Delicioso!","pairing":"Nothing suits Italian food like Italian wine! Montefalco Sangiovese is the perfect choise."},{"id":"3","location":"restaurant","name":"Florida Black Grouper","description":"What a catch! This local fish has firm, lean flesh and a mild flavor. Pan-seared and served on a bed of Farro, you can feel good about eating this healthy dish.","pairing":"Chardonnay is a great match for fish. We've got a great match with Deloach Russian River valley chardonnay."}]
