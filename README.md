USF Senior Project - Wine pairing Android app using AngularJS on Ionic Framework


This project was created using AngularJS on Ionic framework. The project is a wine pairing app to allow a user to search for a food item offered by the either the market or the restaurant. It then displays a recommended wine pairing from the appropriate wine collection.

The project consists of two parts:

1) A website where an adminstrative user can log in to manipulate a database. The admin can add/modify/delete entries. The site was coded with PHP and MySql.

2) An Android based phone app for a guest to search for a desired food item and to display a wine/beverage recommendation. The app was coded using AngularJS on Ionic framework.

##this is not the complete project, as Ionic has 2k+ files and I'm only uploading what I wrote.
